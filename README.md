IG Crypto Holding: The Platform
IG Crypto Holding is a project whose objective is the start-up of a farm for cryptocurrency mining
located in Istanbul. Since Electricity and Climate is a huge factor to consider when establishing a
mining farm, IG Crypto Holding will be taking advantage of the good weather in Istanbul to drive
the mechanisms that will provide power for the start-up.
The results of cryptocurrency mining are highly dependent on the infrastructure efficiency and
electricity rates, which makes renewable energy sources the sort after solution for a cost-effective
and clean mining operation. The farm will be powered by both photovoltaic system with MPPT
(Maximum Power Point Tracker) and wind turbine with electricity. This 100% clean and renewable
energy outcome will be used to directly power our mining equipment. A back-up generator will be
installed also should incase if there is power failure from the photovoltaic system and wind
turbines.
Since our farm provides its own energy, we are providing a multi-algorithm, multi-coin cloud
mining service that uses the latest technology at a very cheap rate as compared to other cloud
mining platforms. We will also offer cheap cloud mining reseller packages to those who want to
sell to their own miners.
The farm will be equipped with high performance computing equipmentâ€™s that will provide the
required computing power needed for cryptocurrency mining. GPU-based and ASIC-based
equipment will be used so as to make mining of different cryptocurrencies possible.
ASIC (Application-specific Integrated Circuits) are the latest cutting-edge tools used in Bitcoin
mining. These tools can be used for mining bitcoins at amazing speeds. GPUs (Graphics Processor
Units) were originally designed to improve and optimize the 3D graphics of the most demanding
video games. They are much faster than the main computer processors (CPUs) at doing specific
calculations, and, thus, are very suitable to mine cryptocurrencies. GPUs couple cutting-edge
speed with high flexibility can mine dozens of different cryptocurrencies, executing various
algorithms, and can adapt to changing market conditions, always working on the most profitable
problems.
For miners to use the IGCH cloud mining service, an ICO (Initial Coin Offering) will be launched, in
which tokens would be sold, to enable miners access our cloud computing power. These tokens
will serve as rental fees. A total 10,000,000,000 IGCH tokens will be issued to allow the rental of
the cloud mining services.

Features of IG Crypto Holding
